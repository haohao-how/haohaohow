# `vercel dev` has a filesystem watcher that opens a file descriptor for every
# file in scope, which can easily exhaust the limit on open file descriptors and
# cause problems like "Error: spawn EBADF" when trying to start a child process
# because when it tries to create a pipe to communicate with the child process,
# it needs a file descriptor, but it can't get one because the limit has been
# reached.
# 
# The `ios` and `android` directories are used when building a development build
# with the expo-dev-client and contain a large number of files which causes this
# problem to occur.
