# Curriculum Design for haohaohow

haohaohow is structured to teach Mandarin Chinese in a way that balances vocabulary, character recognition, and skill dependencies.

## Handling Words with Multiple Meanings

Words like **ÈÅç (bi√†n)** have distinct meanings depending on context. Instead of merging them under one gloss, we split them into separate learning skills.

- **ÈÅç as a measure word** ‚Üí "I read this book three times."
- **ÈÅç as 'everywhere'** ‚Üí "He searched everywhere."

This approach ensures structured learning progression and prevents premature merging in SRS.

## Learning the meaning for a hanzi

haohaohow takes the approach of teaching how to remember the meaning of a hanzi when you see it (i.e. read it) by using a few pieces of information:

- The breakdown of components in the character.
- The relative position or composition of those components.
- The meaning of those components.

As such haohaohow teaches you hanzi in "bottom up" manner where by you learn basic hanzi and radicals first, followed by more complex hanzi that are composed of those components.

---

haohaohow teaches you a short story or mnemonic that ties together the components of a hanzi to remember the meaning. This can work in a few ways:

- imagining something that **looks** like the character (for example ‰∫∫ **looks** like a **person** walking, or ÂÆÄ **looks** like the side profile of a roof with a chimney)
- combining the meaning of the components (e.g. **ceremony** (Á§º) is a **spiritual ritual** (Á§ª) that contains **hidden meaning** (‰πö))
- a combination of the two, i.e. conceptual + visual. (e.g. **use** (‰ª•) has a **person** on the right, and something on the left that you can imagine looks like a rake or plow, you can combine rake/plow + person = **use**)

### Example of learning the meaning of Âèò

Âèò (bi√†n) means **‚Äúto change‚Äù**, **‚Äúto transform‚Äù**, or **‚Äúto become different‚Äù**.

---

üß† Quick breakdown:

| Aspect        | Info                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Pinyin        | bi√†n                     |
| Core meanings | change; transform; alter |
| Extended uses | become; turn into        |

---

üìö Visual decomposition of Âèò:

| Part    | Meaning                                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ‰∫¶ (y√¨) | also; too                                            |
| Êîµ (pu) | action (variant of the ‚Äúhand holding stick‚Äù radical) |

    ‚Ä¢	‰∫¶ (y√¨) roughly means ‚Äúalso‚Äù ‚Äî something additional.
    ‚Ä¢	Êîµ is a common radical related to actions (like Êîª attack, Êïè quick).

So Âèò combines the idea of taking action (Êîµ) and something different/also (‰∫¶), resulting in the idea of changing, transforming from one state to another.

---

‚úÖ Best glosses for your project:

‚Ä¢ ‚Äúchange‚Äù (perfect short gloss)
‚Ä¢ ‚Äútransform‚Äù (for dramatic changes)
‚Ä¢ ‚Äúbecome different‚Äù (more detailed)

I‚Äôd recommend ‚Äúchange‚Äù for simplicity and accuracy.

### Example of learning the meaning of Êéâ

Êéâ (di√†o) means ‚Äúto fall,‚Äù ‚Äúdrop,‚Äù ‚Äúlose,‚Äù or ‚Äúremove‚Äù, depending on the context ‚Äî usually implying something is detached, let go, or no longer present.

üß© Decomposition

Êéâ = ‚ø∞ÊâåÂçì
‚Ä¢ Êâå ‚Üí hand (component form of Êâã)
‚Ä¢ Âçì ‚Üí outstanding, prominent

‚∏ª

üß† Interpretation

A hand (Êâå) lets go of something high up (Âçì) ‚Äî it falls, drops, or is lost.

This fits well with meanings like:
‚Ä¢ Êéâ‰∫Ü ‚Üí ‚Äúit dropped / was lost‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ÊéâÂ§¥ ‚Üí ‚Äúturn one‚Äôs head‚Äù (lit. pivoting action)
‚Ä¢ Êéâ‰∏ãÊù• ‚Üí ‚Äúfall down‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ÊéâËøõÊ∞¥Èáå ‚Üí ‚Äúfell into the water‚Äù

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Common glosses:
‚Ä¢ ‚Äúdrop‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ‚Äúfall‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ‚Äúlose‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ‚Äúremove‚Äù

### Example of learning the meaning of ÊÄÅ

ÊÄÅ (t√†i) means ‚Äúattitude,‚Äù ‚Äúmanner,‚Äù or ‚Äústate (of being)‚Äù.

‚∏ª

üß© Decomposition

ÊÄÅ = ‚ø±Â§™ÂøÉ
‚Ä¢ Â§™ ‚Üí ‚Äútoo much,‚Äù ‚Äúgrand,‚Äù or ‚Äúexcessive‚Äù
‚Ä¢ ÂøÉ ‚Üí heart, emotions, mind (rendered as a component below)

‚∏ª

üß† Interpretation / Mnemonic

Your heart (ÂøÉ) reflects your overarching state (Â§™) ‚Äî your attitude or mental state.

Or:

When your heart is overflowing (Â§™), it shows in your mood or behavior.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Gloss suggestions:
‚Ä¢ attitude
‚Ä¢ manner
‚Ä¢ state
‚Ä¢ posture

‚∏ª

üìö Common words:
‚Ä¢ ÊÄÅÂ∫¶ (t√†id√π) ‚Äì attitude
‚Ä¢ Áä∂ÊÄÅ (zhu√†ngt√†i) ‚Äì state, condition
‚Ä¢ Âä®ÊÄÅ (d√≤ngt√†i) ‚Äì movement, dynamic status
‚Ä¢ ÂøÉÊÄÅ (xƒ´nt√†i) ‚Äì mental state, mindset

### Imagining objects that looks like the object.

Some characters a composed of lots of smaller components that form groups, and by associating a concept with these groups it's possible to create a more concise and efficient mnemonic hint.

For example ‰∫Æ (bright) can be broken down into ‚ø±‚ø≥‰∫†Âè£ÂÜñÂá†, but rather than treating each component separately ‰∫† + Âè£ + ÂÜñ + Âá† = ??? it's better to group them together i.e. ‰∫† + Âè£ + ÂÜñ = ??? and Âá† = ???. Then a meaning can be assigned to each of the two parts, and finally they can be linked together to form the final meaning of **bright**.

It's a good idea to work out what each component means and what it looks like:

| Component | Meaning           | Pictograph                                      |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ‰∫†        | **lid**           | lid, hat, top, profile of group with new growth |
| Âè£        | **mouth/opening** | box, container, building                        |
| ÂÜñ        | **cover/roof**    | roof, base, table cloth, foundation             |
| Âá†        | **small table**   | legs, table                                     |

Then you can group the components into the larger objects:

‰∫† + Âè£ + ÂÜñ = ???

‚Ä¶on top of‚Ä¶

Âá† = ???

And then think about creating a scene with these objects.

What are the objects in the scene, and how do the components form them?

How do those objects relate to the meaning "bright"?

---

A great answer would be:

> Imagine a lantern (‰∫†Âè£ÂÜñ) shining its light down onto a small table (Âá†), making everything around it very bright.

### Examples of pictographs

To be flexible with creating gloss hint mnemonics for single characters made up of multiple components, it's often good to use the pictograph
depiction of the character rather than its meaning if it was a standalone character. For example

| Hanzi | Stand-alone meaning | Component meaning (pictograph) |
| ----- | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Âè£    | mouth               | box                            |
| Âèà    | again               | a hand                         |
